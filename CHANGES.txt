# Changes in release 1.2 (2009-10-07)

- Minor improvements regarding start scripts (spoolerctl, backendctl), 
  Spooler.py and AbstractProgrammingBackend.py.

- Log files are written for each backend now (e.g., haskell.log, junit.log).  


# Changes in release 1.1 (2009-08-25)

- The file structure for backends has been changed.  The new 
  'config.py' contains the interpretor/compiler information only.  All 
  other values are now part of the backend's main class file. 

- Starting spooler and/or backends is now possible without a password
  at the command line.  You can use the '-a' option with a file which
  is used to lookup the password for the given user.  The file 
  contains one 'user:password' entry per line.

- Spooler and backends now use separate log files ('spooler.log' and 
  'backend.log').  A third log file ('event.log') is written and 
  contains all messages.
