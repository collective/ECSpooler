Overview

Description

  The PyUnit backend is a Python XML-RPC service, which provides - in  
  tandem with ECSpooler - automatic testing of Python programs.  
  Therefore the backend uses dynamic tests with the PyUnit framework.

Prerequisites

  * A UNIX or UNIX-like operating system, e.g., NetBSD, Solaris, Mac
    OS X, or Linux.

    The PyUnit backend does run on Windows (with some restrictions),
    but this is neither supported nor recommended.

  * "Python":http://python.org/
  
  * "ECSpooler":http://wdok.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/software/ecspooler
  
  * ECSpooler is primarily intended to be used via the
    "ECAutoAssessmentBox":http://plone.org/products/ecautoassessmentbox
    Plone product.  So you will normally have a Plone installation
    with ECAutoAssessmentBox.
  
Installation

  * Unzip this archive under the 'backends' directory of your 
    ECSpooler installation (for example '/opt/ESpooler/backends/').  
    
  * Adjust values for INTERPRTER and OPTIONS in the script
    'backends/pyunit/python.sh' to your system environemnt.
    
  * Make sure that the script 'backends/pyunit/python.sh' is
    executable.

Security

  When executing unknown code, you have to take security precautions, 
  e.g., by using chroot, jails, or systrace.  These mechanisms are, 
  however, system-dependent, so we cannot give detailed installation
  instructions.
  
  If you are using "systrace":http://www.systrace.org/, adjust the
  script 'backends/pyunit/python+systrace' to your system
  environment and set *INTERPRETER* in	
  'backends/pyunit/config.py' to this script.
  
  Please be aware of the risks if you are *not* able to deal with the
  configuration issues.
  
Quick Start

  After installation, first start ECSpooler (see the ECSpooler
  documentation for details).  Then you should be able to start the 
  PyUnit backend using the following command (you may have to specify 
  the path)::

    backendctl -u root -p bazquux PyUnit start

  If you run this command as root, the process will be started as user
  "nobody".

  Once the backend is running, check the status of the backend using::

    spoolerctl -u root -p bazquux status        

  and get a response similar to::

    {'queue': 0, 'backends': ['pyunit'], 'pid': 27423, 'results': 0}

  For administrative tasks such as starting/stopping backends
  authentication is required.  Therefore ECSpooler ships with a
  password file ('etc/passwd') containing a user "root" with default
  password "bazquux".  See the ECSpooler documentation if you would
  like to add/change users and passwords.
 
  Testing a Python program with the PyUnit backend requires exactly 
  one test class with one or more test cases, e.g.,::  
  
    import unittest

    class testSquare(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def testSquare1(self):
            self.assertEqual(25, square(5), 'Re-check your implementation.')
 
        def testSquare2(self):
            self.assertEqual(25, square(-5), 'Take care about negative numbers.')
