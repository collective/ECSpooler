Overview

Description

  The Keywords backend is a simple backend for automatic keyword 
  spotting.

Prerequisites

  * A UNIX or UNIX-like operating system, e.g., NetBSD, Solaris, Mac
    OS X, or Linux.

    The PyUnit backend does run on Windows (with some restrictions),
    but this is neither supported nor recommended.

  * "Python":http://python.org/
  
  * "ECSpooler":http://wdok.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/software/ecspooler
  
  * ECSpooler is primarily intended to be used via the
    "ECAutoAssessmentBox":http://plone.org/products/ecautoassessmentbox
    Plone product.  So you will normally have a Plone installation
    with ECAutoAssessmentBox.
  
Installation

  * Unzip this archive under the 'backends' directory of your 
    ECSpooler installation (for example '/opt/ESpooler/backends/').  
  
Quick Start

  After installation, first start ECSpooler (see the ECSpooler
  documentation for details).  Then you should be able to start the 
  PyUnit backend using the following command (you may have to specify 
  the path)::

    backendctl -u root -p bazquux Keywords start

  If you run this command as root, the process will be started as user
  "nobody".

  Once the backend is running, check the status of the backend using::

    spoolerctl -u root -p bazquux status        

  and get a response similar to::

    {'queue': 0, 'backends': ['keywords'], 'pid': 27423, 'results': 0}

  For administrative tasks such as starting/stopping backends
  authentication is required.  Therefore ECSpooler ships with a
  password file ('etc/passwd') containing a user "root" with default
  password "bazquux".  See the ECSpooler documentation if you would
  like to add/change users and passwords.
